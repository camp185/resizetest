Trying to come up with a solve for a client that has unusually limited veritcial space. Average width PC 1366, average height...around 600px. Many of the users addtionally have extra toolbars there, reducing thigns even more. 

In an effort to maximize an overlay to max out there vertical space, but still look relatively normal on a larger monitor, this is a possible fix...Reducing everything by the same percentage that I must reduce the vertical space to be entirely on screen.
